# Tours

A simple React app that fetches info on tours packages from an API (destination, info, price, and an image and displays it. It also allows for the user on the click of a link (Read More)...

![Tours](/public/tours-hide-info.png?raw=true "Tours display") 

...to obtain more info on a specific tour. At that point in the display the user can choose to go back to the original display with less information on that specific tour, by clicking "Show Less", or to clear away all the data of a specific tour.

The app is based on the eponimous project that appears in the tutorial [Code 15 React Projects - Complete Course](https://youtu.be/a_7Z7C_JCyo) by freeCodeCamp.org.
