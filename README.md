# Tours

> "Tours" is a simple app that fetches info on tours packages from an API (destination, info, price, and an image) displays it . It also allows for the user on the click of a button to toggle between more and less information on display, and to clear away all the data of a specific tour. The app is based on the eponimous project that appears in the tutorial [Code 15 React Projects - Complete Course](https://youtu.be/a_7Z7C_JCyo) by freeCodeCamp.org.
